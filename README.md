### UNHCR Refugee Data
Using data provided by the UNHCR on asylees and refugees migration from 2000 through 2016, I tried to create models to accurately predict acceptance percentage on a per group basis.

#### Methodology, Challenges, Key Results, Next Steps/Conclusion

### Blog Authors
Using nltk and spacy, I predicted the author of blog posts from a corpus of blogs of approximately 200 authors.


### Hate in USA
Does the presence of hate groups in a city or a state increase the number of hate crimes in the USA? What patterns of growth or decline are apparent in different hate group categories?

Using data from the FBI and the Southern Poverty Law Center, a hate group watchdog, I set out to analyze patterns of hate groups, hate crimes, and answer these questions. 

The project is split into 4 parts: 
* Summary - if you would like a quick(er) overview of all of the following sections 
* Data import and cleaning - for a closer look at that process
* Data analysis - exploring different aspects of the data, and a little bit of feature engineering
* Modeling - more feature engineering, regression models to predict the number of hate crimes in each category based on features for each city with data
